I am having some issues with the component HobbieItem.js ***
Array destructuration: const [selectedItems, setSelectedItems] = useState([]);***
setSelectedItems is the function to add the value of the selected item into the array: selectedItems.***
Unfortunately, the 'selectedItems' array is not keeping track of the previously selected item. It is only showing the most recent element in console.log
